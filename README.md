# job_scheduling

I wrote this code for the following practical task. 

Assume a set of N jobs, ji, i = 1..N, of known durations, d(ji) = duration of job ji. Each job needs to be completed by one of M engineers, ei, i = 1..M. 
The distances between each job site and the base location of each engineer are known. 
Propose an algorithm to schedule the jobs such that the travel time from the base locations to the job sites is minimised across the entire team of engineers. 
The jobs are of equal priority and need to be scheduled no sooner than 9 am and no later than 5 pm on any given day. 
There is no restriction regarding the number of days in the schedule.
